* Chess is an abstract strategy game that involves no hidden information and no elements of chance. 
* It is played on a chessboard with 64 squares arranged in an 8Ã—8 grid. 
* each player controls sixteen pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, and eight pawns. White moves first, followed by Black.

## Description of Piece

1)Pawn

* Pawn Movement: Pawns move forward vertically on the chessboard, one square at a time. They can move from their starting position either one square or two squares forward on their first move.

* Capturing: Pawns capture diagonally. If there is an opponent's piece one square diagonally in front of them, the pawn can capture that piece by moving diagonally to that square. Pawns cannot capture by moving straight forward.


* No Backward Movement: Pawns cannot move backward. Once a pawn has moved forward, it can never move back to a previous rank.


* First Move: On their first move, pawns have the option to move forward one square or two squares. After that, they can only move one square at a time.

2)Rook

* Rook Movement: The rook moves in straight lines, either horizontally (along the ranks) or vertically (along the files) on the chessboard. It can move any number of squares in these directions, as long as there are no pieces blocking its path.

* Capturing: The rook captures an opponent's piece by moving to the square occupied by that piece, either horizontally or vertically. The rook captures by replacing the captured piece on the board.

* No Diagonal Movement: Unlike bishops, rooks do not move diagonally. They only move in straight lines.

* Rook Pairs: In the initial position, each player starts with two rooks. Each rook can move independently. This allows for the possibility of castling, a special move that involves the king and one of the rooks.

3)Knight

* Knight Movement: The knight moves in an "L" shape: it can move two squares in one direction (either horizontally or vertically) and then one square perpendicular to that direction, or it can move two squares in one direction (either vertically or horizontally) and then one square perpendicular to that direction.
It can move two squares vertically and one square horizontally (or vice versa).
It can move two squares horizontally and one square vertically (or vice versa).

* Capturing: The knight captures an opponent's piece by moving to the square occupied by that piece, following the "L" shape movement.

* Color Independence: Knights do not have any color preferences; they can move to any square on the board, regardless of whether it's a light square or a dark square.

4)bishop

* Diagonal Movement: The bishop can move diagonally in any direction across the chessboard. It can move any number of squares diagonally, as long as there are no pieces blocking its path.

* Color-Bound: Each player has two bishops at the start of the game, one on a light square and one on a dark square. Bishops are "color-bound" in the sense that they remain on the squares of their starting color throughout the game. For example, a bishop starting on a light square will always stay on light squares and cannot move to dark squares, and vice versa.

* Capturing: The bishop captures an opponent's piece by moving to the square occupied by that piece along a diagonal path.


5)king

* King Movement: The king can move to any adjacent (orthogonal or diagonal) square on the chessboard. In other words, the king can move one square in any direction: horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.


* Limited Range: The king has a very limited range of movement, typically only one square in any direction, which makes it vulnerable to threats. It's important to keep the king well-protected throughout the game.

6) Queen 

* Queen Movement: The queen can move in straight lines, either horizontally (along ranks), vertically (along files), or diagonally (along diagonals), covering as many squares as are available in the chosen direction. It can move any number of squares in these directions.

* Capturing: The queen captures an opponent's piece by moving to the square occupied by that piece, following the straight line or diagonal path of its movement.

* Versatility: Due to its ability to move in multiple directions and cover long distances, the queen is often considered the most versatile and powerful piece on the board. It can control and influence a significant portion of the chessboard, making it a critical asset in both offense and defense.
